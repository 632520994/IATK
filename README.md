The Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK) is designed to help you build and interact with data visualizations in immersive environments (Virtual and Augmented Reality) in Unity.
With IATK, load CSV/TSV files and write simple code using the library to create immersive data visualisations.
IATK provides a *Visualisation* script to help you create and design visualizations within the Unity editor.

IATK is an open project! We setup a roadmap with features that we would like to see in IATK. 
Feel free to contribute :)

## Toolkit components and facilities
1. Graphics toolkit
The toolkit contains facilities to create high quality graphics dsigned for data visualisation in Virtual and Augmented Reality. The IATK core graphics tools include:

- a **BigMesh** script that allows the creation of visualisations 
- several shaders to render a lot of data rapidly and efficiently, and custom graphics for data visualisations (thick lines, dots/spheres, cubes/bars)
- a selection tool (brushing) that enables the selection of data accross several data visualizations.

2. Visualisation helper
IATK has an editor script that enables you to design and filter data visualisations.

 - Vive
 - Hololens
 - Meta

## Official members and developpers
The toolkit is developped by Maxime Cordeil (project leader, Monash University), Kingsley Stephens (Monash University) and Andrew Cunningham (University of South Australia).
