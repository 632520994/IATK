# IATK: Immersive Analytics Toolkit (Comming soon)

The Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK) is designed to help you build data visualizations in immersive environments (Virtual and Augmented) using Unity.
With IATK, load CSV/TSV files and write simple code using the library to create immersive data visualisations.
IATK provides a *Visualisation* script facility to help you create visualisations inside the Unity editor.

IATK is an open project! We setup a roadmap with features that we would like to see in IATK. 
Feel free to contribute :)

## Main components:
1. Graphics toolkit
The toolkit contains facilities to create high quality graphics deisgned for data visualisation in Virtual and Augmented Reality. IATK includes:

- a **BigMesh** class that enables the creation of visualisations that display more than 65K data points 
- shaders to create fast, efficient and custom graphics for data visualisations (thick lines, dots/spheres and cubes)
