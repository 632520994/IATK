The Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK) is designed to help you build and interact with data visualizations in immersive environments (Virtual and Augmented Reality) in Unity.
With IATK, load CSV/TSV files and write simple code using the library to create immersive data visualisations.
IATK provides a *Visualisation* script facility to help you create visualisations with the Unity editor.

IATK is an open project! We setup a roadmap with features that we would like to see in IATK. 
Feel free to contribute :)

## Main components:
1. Graphics toolkit
The toolkit contains facilities to create high quality graphics dsigned for data visualisation in Virtual and Augmented Reality. The IATK core graphics tools include:

- a **BigMesh** class that enables the creation of visualisations that display more than 65K data points 
- several shaders to render a lot of data fast, efficient and custom graphics for data visualisations (thick lines, dots/spheres, cubes)
- a selection tool (brushing) that enables selection of data accross several data visualizations.

1. Visualisation helper

IATK has an editor script that enables you to design and filter data visualisations.
